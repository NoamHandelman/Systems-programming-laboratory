This file gathers assumptions and explanations according to which this project was
written, When some of the assumptions are based on what is written in the course
forum and some are based on the original instructions in the course booklet 
(it is important to note that it was not possible to reach all the threads in 
the forum).

1. The restrictions on label name and macro name are the same.
2. This is not an error if a label is defined more than once as an entry.
3. This is not an error if a label is defined more than once as an extern.
4. The machine code image is given a fixed size which is the memory size of the machine on which the project is based (4096).
5. The alignment in the ent and ext files is done according to the length of the longest possible label (which is 31).
6. The main documentation of the functions is in the header files.
7.The reserved words that cannot appear as a label or macro name are: all operation 
names, all register names, the four instruction names (.entry, .extern, .string, 
.data) and macr, endmacr.
8. Comment line is valid only if the ; is the first token in the line.
